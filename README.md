# Predict-Customer-Churn-in-Python
This project involves analyzing a dataset and building a model to predict whether a customer will leave a bank or not. The project includes performing exploratory data analysis, selecting features, converting categorical columns to numeric columns, feature scaling, model training, feature importance analysis, confusion matrix, classification metrics, cross-validation, and presenting the results.
